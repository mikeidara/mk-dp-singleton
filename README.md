# Description
This repository show how to implement singleton design pattern. This is a part of my design pattern project tutorial.

# What is singleton design pattern
When you think that one object must be unique, this object is "singleton". There are many cases in our every day life that we are face to unique object. If we consider that you are the application, you can also think that those things will be unique: God, your father/mother, your wife (in general ;) ), your country, ...
When we talk about application, we can have objects that must be unique: database, filesystem handler, ...  

# Used example
In this tutorial, we will use the example of a wife. Yes! your beautiful darling is unique and you can't fool her (Wait! No?! ;) )
We will see threes scenarios:
- how to behave like a good guy? / how do you use your singleton object? 
- when you try to be unfaithful  / try to instantiate your class and you'll get hurt ;) 
- your wife is everywhere        / you can compare all instances. At the end, you will realize that they point to the same reference

# Technos
- Backend: php / symfony 
- Rest API: We will only GET for these threes scenarios

# Implementation
